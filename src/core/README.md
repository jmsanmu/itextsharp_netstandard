iTextSharp (LGPL / MPL) 4.2.0
=============================

iTextSharp is a port of the iText open source Java library for PDF generation written entirely in C# for the .NET platform. This repository contains the source code of the last version of the library released under the Mozilla Public License and the LGPL, before the project moved to the AGPL. You can use this version if you need a free PDF library for use in closed-source projects.

This repository contains the iText library 4.2.0 forked from the original repository. Minor change to make the project compatible with the .NET Standard 2.0.

This is just a mirror. Use by your own responsability.
